### TASK

You are the founder of a new small business.  Create a multi-page website for your hypothetical small business that features at least two products that you plan to sell.  


### DUE DATE 

For your sketch: Wednesday, November 8, at 10:40am 

For the full project: Tuesday, November 14, at 10:40am

### RUBRIC


1. Your site must consist of at least four distinct web pages:
    * (10 points) A homepage named index.html that includes a carousel and gives an overview of your company and a brief description of the products you sell. 
    * (10 points) Two product pages that go into more detail about two different products that your company sells.  Each page must have at least one image on it. 
    * (10 points) An “About the Founder” page that includes an avatar image and at least one paragraph about yourself.  (Notes: Make sure NOT to include any personal identifying information about yourself.  Only use your first name and last initial.  Do not include your date of birth, address, phone number, etc.  Your avatar image does not have to be custom.  It can be directly downloaded from a Google Search.) 

2. (20 points) First, sketch your homepage (just the homepage, not all four pages of your site) and submit on Google Classroom.  Your sketch is a basic drawing of the content of the page.  From your sketch, I should be able to tell: the name of your companty, the products you sell, the captions on all carousel slides, and 2-3 additional details about your company. You can complete your sketch on pen and paper, take a picture with your phone, and upload to Google Classroom.  Alternatively, you can develop your sketch digitally with Google Slides or Jamboard and directly submit it on Google Classroom.  

3. (10 points) Each page of your site must include a navigation bar with working links to all of your pages.

4. (10 points) Your homepage must use a [Bootstrap carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/carousel/) with at least three slides that include images.

5. (10 points) At least one of your pages must utilize the [Bootstrap Grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/). It is required to utilize at least two rows of content.  In addition, you must use at least three different `col-*-*` tags.  (For example, the correct use of a `col-md-3`, `col-md-6`, and `col-md-9` would fulfill this requirement, but three uses `col-md-4` would NOT. )

6. (20 points) All three of your pages must be mobile-friendly.  In particular, I will view your pages at a width of 1280 pixels (i.e. widescreen width) and 428 pixels (i.e. phone width).  All content on your page should adapt for both screen sizes.  In particular:
      * all text and images should be fully visible on both small and large screens
      * the carousel should disappear on small screens, and its information should be presented in a more appropriate manner
      * the navigation bar should render vertically on small screens and horizontally on wide screens
      * any grid layouts should "stack"   

A couple of reminders:
Even though our replit platform is private, you should never put any personally identifiable information on any website you make, including this one. 
The text that you include on your webpage should be your own writing and not plagiarized from another source.
